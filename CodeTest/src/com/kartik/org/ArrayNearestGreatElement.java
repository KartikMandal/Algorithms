 * Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. 
 * The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element 
 * on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element 
 * exist, consider next greater element as -1. The next greater elements 
 * should be printed in same order as input array.
 * Example 1: 
 * Question: There is an array A[N] of N numbers. You have to compose an array Output[N] such that each element in Output[i] 
 * will tell the next greater element to the right in the original array. If there is no greater number to the right, then 
 * the output array should contain -1 in that position.

Array 1: {4, 6, 5, 4, 3, 4, 9, 8, 1}

Output: {6, 9, 9, 9, 4, 9, -1, -1, -1}

Let us try to understand the problem statement. We are given an input array that has some random numbers. We need to produce
 another output array that contains the �Next Greater Element� for each of the corresponding numbers of the original array.
  If there does not exist a greater element to the right, we simply replace it with �-1�.

In the sample input let us try to look at the elements.

Element	Next Greater Element	Reason
4		6						The next element to 4
6		9						The next elements 5, 4, 3, 4 are smaller than 6. 9 is greater
5		9						The next elements 4, 3, 4 are smaller than 5. 9 is greater
4		9						The next elements 3, 4, are smaller/equal to 4. 9 is greater
3		4						The next element greater is 4
4		9						The next element greater is 9
9		-1						The next elements 8, 1 are smaller than 9. Hence -1
8		-1						The next element 1 is smaller than 8. Hence -1
1		-1						There is no element to the right, so no element is greater. Hence -1
We can easily deduce that the last element of the output array will always be �-1� since there will be no element greater than it on the right.
